// new global exp system
// because new public trunk has now a limited bonus exp logic, i need to rebuild my logics here, also my old logics were not the best.

global.h
added a global_exp_adjust, this is for code change only and can adjust server exp. (fast level servers, hard grind servers, season servers, local servers)
changed global_exp_bonus interpretation from +100*x% to *x%
EXTERN float                    global_exp_adjust; // server EXP adjust factor
EXTERN float                    global_exp_bonus;  // server EXP bonus factor for all players

main.c
global_exp_adjust = 2.0f; // 100% more exp (double exp) when server starts
global_exp_bonus = 1.0f;  // 0% bonus when server starts
// todo build in a timerlogic and a server crash/restart save logic to keep bonus
