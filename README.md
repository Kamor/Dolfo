My presentation server for www.daimonin.org.
This is public trunk from https://sourceforge.net/p/daimonin/code/HEAD/tree/.
I show my changes and ideas here, if dev-team like it, they can grap it.

My changes:

New food system:
- apply.c capped food to only eat one food same time
- lib/artifacts new potions
- scripts/alchemist.lua and new npc in guildhall_a_030a selling potions
