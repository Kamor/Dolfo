# Dolfo
My presentation server for www.daimonin.org.
This is public trunk from https://sourceforge.net/p/daimonin/code/HEAD/tree/.
I show my changes and ideas here, if dev-team like it, they can grap it.

My changes in c code:
- win32.h insert guard block 
- daimonin_object.cd removed SetSkill cap for indirect skills
- apply.c capped food to only eat one food same time
